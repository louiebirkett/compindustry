A repository for our group project
*****

Our group project is to create a website that introduces secondary school students to the fundamentals of information, computer and network security. 

The site should give students -
  an understanding of security mechanisms that can protect information systems,
  an understanding of the issues around privacy in business information systems
  an appreciation of techniques for mitigating privacy threats through appropriate security controls

Considerations:

  demonstrate consideration of your target audience
  demonstration of fundamentals of project management
  provide evidence of working as a team
  relevant legal, social and ethical issues
  demonstration of both written and verbal communication skills
