            Network security is an extensive concept that encompasses a wide
            range of technology, processes, and devices. In its most basic form, it
            is an organised collection of rules and configurations that use both 
            hardware and software technologies to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and
            accessibility of computer networks and data.
            Every organisation, regardless of size, industry, or infrastructure, 
            requires network security solutions to protect it from the ever-changing landscape of 
            cyber threats within the open internet, today.
          </h2>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Most networks will have a <u>network manager</u> who is in charge of the 
              day-to-day operation of the network, and part of their job is to manage 
              security and ensure that only authorised people can connect to the network.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            
          <p>
              There are a number of differing ways of doing this:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Encryption
            </li>
            <li>
              Firewalls
            </li>
            <li>
              MAC address filtering
            </li>
            <li>
              Authentication
            </li>
          </ol>
          <br>
          
          <h3>
            Encryption,:
          </h3>
          <p>Encryption, is a technique in which data is turned into an unreadable format that can 
            only be interpreted via a key to decrypt the encrypted data, this essentially means that 
            if a laptop is stolen, the thief cannot simply take out the <u>hard drive</u> and steal your data, as a key is required to read it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Encryption can be used in conjunction with authentication. 
            On Mac computers, for example, the operating system encrypts data on the hard drive. 
            When a user enters their password to gain access to their account, the data is not encrypted, 
            and they can read what is there. However, if someone else tries to take it, they must first gain 
            access to the user's account before they can access any of the data.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>
            Firewalls:
          </h3>
          <p>
            A firewall is a software that manages what data is permitted to 
            enter and exit a network. It serves as a barrier between a trusted and untrustworthy 
            networks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most networks, for example, are used (partially) to connect devices to the internet, 
            but this poses a <b>significant security risk</b>. A network manager can use a firewall to 
            control which data packets can enter and exit the trusted network, and it will block any 
            unauthorised packets travelling in either direction.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>
            MAC address filtering:
          </h3>
          <p>
            All network-connected devices are assigned a permanent physical address known 
            as a MAC Address. This address is unique to each device and cannot be changed, 
            making it easy to identify individual devices on a network.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within universites, many students will use the internet in their residence halls, however, 
            this could pose a security risk, to mitigate this risk, a set number of devices can only connect to the university 
            internet, and if the <b>network manager</b> deems the student's browsing search is unsafe and poses a risk
            to the network (Deep web surfing, etc), then they can revoke the students rights and stop the device from connecting.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          <h3>
            Authentication:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Is the process of determining whether or not a user is who or what they claim to be. Authentication technology
            controls system access by determining whether a user's credentials match those in a database of authorised users
            or in a data authentication server.
          </p>
          <p>
            Essentially, Authentication ensures secure systems, secure processes, and enterprise information security in this way.
